Collatz
=======

This is a simple program that takes takes a positive integer as input and prints the
[Collatz sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) starting at the given number.

This program is implemented in Golang as a quick, but entertaining exercise to reinforce the basic
constructs in Golang, such as functions, if-else blocks, variable assignment, and looping. But the
program also uses some more advanced concepts and tools such as the `os` and `strconv` packages.
